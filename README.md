# README

Welcome to "Humans of Seattle & Beyond", a web application that enables users to catalog their encounters with interesting people around the world.

* This project was built with Ruby on Rails. The Ruby version is ruby-2.6.1

* Data is stored with sqlite3. The database was initially seeded with a few temporary stories that were manually created in the seed file as well as a list of countries that were parsed from a CSV file. 

* At the moment there is no test suite for this project.

* To fire up this project and start writing fun stories, you must first fork & clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open up this project in your preferred IDE. 

* Run bundle install in order to have access to all the gems in this project:

```
bundle install
```

* From here, start up the rails server by entering "rails s" in your terminal:

```
rails s
```

* Navigate to your local host, in this case most likely http://localhost:3000/

* Start writing!
